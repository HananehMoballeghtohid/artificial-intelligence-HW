    "# Quoridor Game Rules (Implementation)\n",
    "## Board\n",
    "\n",
    "9 × 9 grid of cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rows numbered 1–9 from top to bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Columns numbered 1–9 from left to right.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Players\n",
    "\n",
    "Two players: MAX (player 1) and MIN (player 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each player has:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One pawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 10 walls.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Starting Positions\n",
    "\n",
    "MAX pawn: row 1, column 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "MIN pawn: row 9, column 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "MAX wins by reaching row 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "MIN wins by reaching row 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pawns\n",
    "\n",
    "Can move to adjacent squares: up, down, left, right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can jump over opponent if directly adjacent and no wall in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can move diagonally if the direct jump over opponent is blocked by a wall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cannot move outside the board or into a square blocked by a wall.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Walls\n",
    "\n",
    "Each player can place walls until they have none left.\n",
    "\n",
    "Walls can be horizontal (H) or vertical (V).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each wall blocks two passages between cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Walls cannot overlap any existing wall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Walls cannot completely block a path for either player; there must always be at least one valid path from each pawn to its goal row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once placed, walls cannot be moved or removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Turns\n",
    "\n",
    "Players alternate turns.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a turn, a player may:\n",
    "\n",
    "Move their pawn according to the movement rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Place a wall according to the placement rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Game End\n",
    "\n",
    "The game ends when one pawn reaches the opponent’s starting row.\n",
    "\n",
    "The player who reaches the goal row first wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Anchors (row, column) are an implementation detail for walls, representing the top-left cell of a wall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Legal moves are automatically calculated to enforce rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wall placement conflicts and path-blocking are checked programmatically."
